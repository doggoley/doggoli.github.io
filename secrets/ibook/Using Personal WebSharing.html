All you do is put theitems you want to share in the Web Pages folder and turn on WebSharing.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1">As long as your computer is connected to a TCP/IPnetwork (intranet or Internet) and your server is running (turned onin the Web Sharing control panel), the server's content is availableto users of the network. You control what items are shared and whocan see those items, by using the standard Mac OS filesharing privileges. You can specify who has access to items andassign a password to some or all of your Web server's content.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1">You should have two components: theWeb Sharing control panel (in the Control Panels folder) and the WebPages folder (in the Documents folder at the top level of your hard disk). You use thecontrol panel to turn Web Sharing on or off, to configure the wayyour server operates, and to designate the folder and home page youwant to use as your server. The Web Pages folder holds the contentsyou want to share.</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=200>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#What you need for Personal">What you need         for Personal Web Sharing</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Quick setup">Quick setup</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Before you turn on Web Sharing">Before you         turn on Web Sharing</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Configuring your Web server">Configuring         your Web server</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Using Personal">Using Personal Web         Sharing</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Getting the most">Getting the most from your         server</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Learningmore">Learning more about Web         Sharing</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Trouble">Troubleshooting</A></B>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=11>         <P><B><A HREF="#Gloss">Glossary</A></B>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P><H3><A NAME="What you need for Personal"></A><FONT SIZE="+1">What youneed for Personal Web Sharing</FONT></H3><P><B>System:</B> <FONT SIZE="+1">You need Mac OS 8.5 or a laterversion and either Open Transport 2.0 or a later version(recommended) with an active TCP/IP network connection.</FONT></P><H3><A NAME="Quick setup"></A><FONT SIZE="+1">Quick setup</FONT></H3><P><FONT SIZE="+1">The procedure that follows provides a briefversion of setting up Personal Web Sharing.

For example,don't put an alias of your hard disk in the Web server folder unlessyou want to share the disk's contents through your server. Check allitems that have aliases in the Web server folder to verify that youwant to share them. (The default setting for access through aliasesis off to prevent inadvertent sharing of items outside the serverfolder.)</FONT></P><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00AF00">Tip:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1"> You canuse an alias to serve files or a disk outside your Web server folder.For example, if you want to include the contents of a CD in yourserver, mount the CD, make an alias of it, and put the alias insidethe Web folder.
