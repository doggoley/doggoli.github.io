You can open the page in your browser in one windowand open the same file in SimpleText or another text-handling programin another window. That way you see the HTML codes and theiron-screen results.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="Graphics/docimage1.GIF" WIDTH=503HEIGHT=134 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=1ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="Graphics/docimage2.GIF" WIDTH=506HEIGHT=284 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=1ALIGN=bottom></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1">The figures above show a portion of the "personal"template in a browser (upper figure) and in HTML text (lower figure).You can study the text codes and see their effects in the finisheddocument.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Copy-and-paste-efficiency:</FONT></B><FONTSIZE="+1"> When you identify the HTML for a feature or an entire pagelayout you like, you can substitute your own text and graphics forthe original content. Of course your new content may change the lookof the page somewhat, depending on the size of images and the amountof text you use.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Borrowing is painless:</FONT></B><FONTSIZE="+1"> When you find a Web page you like while browsing, you cancopy its source with your browser. For example, in Netscape Navigatoryou open the View menu and choose Document Source to save the page'sHTML as a SimpleText file. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Tables for page layout:</FONT></B><FONTSIZE="+1"> One quick way to create columns on a page is to define atable in HTML. (Many Web page-creation programs, such as Claris HomePage, include simple table construction tools.) You can vary thewidth and height of cells in the table to accommodate your text andimages.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Hidden text:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1"> Tablesoften display cells containing text differently from cells withoutany content. To assure that all cells are alike, you can put "hidden"text in empty cells. Simply type a phrase, select it, and make it thesame color as the background. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Naming files:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1"> Usefile names that reveal the file's content or that indicate whichother files they are connected to. For instance, you might name imagefiles with a short form of the Web page on which they are used and anumber to indicate their order among images on that page. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Spotting files:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1"> Toidentify the major types of files for your Web content, you can colortheir icons. Using short designations as part of the file name canalso make each type of file easy to spot. Many people use "html" atthe end of a name for text files with HTML coding, forexample.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Checking content:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1">One essential step in creating Web content is checking your pagefrequently in a browser. Or better yet, in several differentbrowsers. Each browser has some quirks of its own, and you can learnto work around them by checking your work as you develop and refineyour pages and images.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1">For more tips and comprehensive references aboutWeb content, visit the sites that are </FONT><FONTSIZE="+1"><A HREF="../Using%20Personal%20WebSharing.html#Learningmore">sourcesof information on Web design</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"> (noted in thedocument "Using Personal WebSharing.html").</FONT></P><H5><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#000000"><HR>[</FONT><A HREF="Using%20Sample%20FilesTemplates.htm">Top ofPage</A><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#000000">][</FONT><A HREF="http://www.apple.com">Apple</A><FONT SIZE="+2"COLOR="#000000">]</FONT></CENTER></H5><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">&copy; 1996 Apple Computer, Inc.
